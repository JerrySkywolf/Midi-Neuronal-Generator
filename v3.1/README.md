# Midi-Neuronal-Generator
This program aims to generate listenable midi sequences.

Sincerely thanks for keras, the neuronal network model we have applied.
In this program, we have combined two GRU layer, and a Dense layer with the activation Softmax, due to GRU has a fater processing speed than LSTM.
